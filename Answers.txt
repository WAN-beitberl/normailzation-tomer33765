1. First, the column PURCHESES is a repeating group, thus, this is a violation 
   of first normal form. Second, the column name depends on the column customerId 
   which is not the primary key. This is a violation of the Third normal form.
   Third, the data in the table will be better represented as two tables, thus, 
   this a violation of fifth normal form. 

2. An update anomaly can occur when we update a customer name/customerId, and then
   it is not updated in the entire purchases of this client. 
   A deletion anomaly can happen when we want to delete all of the purchases of a
   client but not the client itself - this table definition will cause the client 
   itself to be deleted because he has no purchases.
   An insertion anomaly can occur when we want to insert a new client that has no
   purchases.
